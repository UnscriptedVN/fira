"""The player module contains the functions and classes necessary to manipulate players in
    a minigame world.

The module contains a class that lets players control the behavior of their minigame counterpart
    by moving in a given direction, collecting an item, etc. (`CSPlayer`). To prevent accidental
    manipulation of the original world data, the player class uses its own position property to
    update its location.
