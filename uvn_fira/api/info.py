    .. WARNING::
        This function may no longer be supported in future releases of the Fira API and may cause
            unexpected results. It is recommended to use `MinigameLevel` instead of this function
            when possible.

    Arguments:
        level (int): The level number as indicated by the minigame.
        fn_path (str): The path to where the NadiaVM file will be written to. This excludes
            the file name itself.
        **kwargs (dict): Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Kwargs:
        config_file (str): The path to the level configuration file, excluding the file name.
        exists (callable): The function to use, if not relying on the built-in `os` module
            to determine whether the configuration file path is loadable.
        load (callable): The function to use, if not relying on the the built-in `open`
            function to load the file object.

    Returns:
        info (tuple): A tuple containing the `uvn_fira.api.player.CSPlayer` object and the
            `uvn_fira.api.world.CSWorld` object

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0-beta1

    This class is designed to be used with the `with` argument as a means to directly write virtual
        machine code without any abstraction involved.

    When used in a context with the `with` statement, the minigame level class may also return the
        configuration data for the level. This can be used to programmatically determine what needs
        to be written as VM code.

    Example:
    ```python
    with MinigameLevel(1) as vm, data:
        devices = data.devices().as_list()
        vm.alloc("world_coins", devices)
        vm.alloc("inventory", devices)
        for device in devices:
            vm.set(device)
            vm.push("world_coins", devices.index(device))
