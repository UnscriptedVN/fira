"""The grid submodule contains a public-facing version of the internal grid used in the Unscripted
    minigame core.

The world grid is a two-dimensional array (list of lists) that contain strings that determine what
    element is present at the specific row and column. The main class responsible for working with
    the grid, `CSWorldGrid`, is a clean and lightweight implementation of this grid with multiple
    utilities to manage it. The grid implementation is not dependent on the `numpy` library and is
    geared towards accessing elements and other information, rather than mathematical operations.
