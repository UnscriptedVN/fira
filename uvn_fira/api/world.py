"""The world module contains all of the classes and functions necessary to visualize
    and gather information about the game world.

The module contains the base grid class responsible for making two-dimensional arrays
    organized like a grid easier to work with (`minigame.api.grid.CSWorldGrid`), as well as the
    world class that contains all of the world's information such as the player's position and
    coins (`CSWorld`).

## World Implementation
Worlds are organized as a grid-like, two-dimensional array (matrix) consisting of rows and columns.
    Each element in the grid contains a string that describes what the world element at that
    position in the grid is. There are five possible options:

- `"PLAYER"`, which refers to the player character
- `"WALL"`, which refers to a wall
- `"COIN"`, which refers to a collectable coin
- `"EXIT"`, which refers to an exit
- `"AIR"`, which refers to a space that doesn't have a particular item

In most scenarios, the world itself does not get modified directly since the layout of items in the
    world need to be preserved. The `CSPlayer` object in the `player` module of the API handles
    world manipulation when a world is passed into its constructor, and most scripts will make a
    copy of world information such as the number of coins and the player's starting position.

It may be impractical in some cases to access an element in the grid directly. The
    `minigame.api.grid.CSWorldGrid` class allows for the world grid to be used in a more practical
    manner by making common operations such as getting a list containing coordinates of a specific
    type of item and getting the first instance of an item easier.
