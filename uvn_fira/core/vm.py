"""This submodule contains the low-level virtual machine reader for the minigame
code.

## Implementation

The Unscripted API and the minigame GUI eventually write files readable by the
Nadia Virtual Machine (NVM). The Nadia Virtual Machine is a stack-based virtual
machine designed to perform operations specific to the Unscripted minigame.

### Commands
In the NadiaVM, there are several commands:

- `alloc (str) (int)`: Create a new array with a name and a specific size.
- `collect`: Collect a coin in the world. Acts like a pause in VM.
- `push (str) (int)`: Push the top of the stack to the given array at the index.
- `pop (str) (int)`: Pop the item located at the array's index and move it to the
    top of the stack.
- `set constant (any)`: Set the top of the stack to a constant value.
- `move player (str)`: Move the player in a given direction.
- `exit player`: Try to end the execution script and finish the level.
