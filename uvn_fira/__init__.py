"""The `uvn_fira` package contains the API and core modules for the Fira backend.

Fira is the backend for the minigame in Unscripted. Fira includes a user-facing API to solve puzzles
    using Python code, and it provides the utilities and classes necessary to parse and execute
    virtual machine code for the Nadia virtual machine.

## What this package includes
The `api` submodule contains the API utilities players can use to generate code for the virtual
    machine to execute and solve puzzles. Documentation is provided in copies of Unscripted.

The `core` submodule contains the backend utilities such as the virtual machine language processor,
    virtual machine readers and writers, and world configuration utilities.
