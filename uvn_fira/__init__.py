"""The `uvn_fira` package contains the API and core modules for the Fira backend.

Fira is the main backend and API code for the minigame in Unscripted, a visual novel about
    software development. Fira provides many facets of the minigame, including a public API that
    players can use to code solutions to the minigame puzzles, a configuration and data generator
    from level files, and a virtual machine that runs low-level code that the minigame processes
    (NadiaVM). Fira is named after Fira Sans, one of the game's characters.
